Overview
========
All of ``autoregistry``'s functionality comes from the ``Registry`` object.

.. code-block:: python

   from autoregistry import Regisry

To use the ``Registry`` object, we can either inherit it, or directly invoke
it to create a ``Registry`` object. We'll be investigating these two usecases.


Inheritence-Based
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Generally, when inherting ``Registry``, we are defining an interface, and thusly
an `abstract base class`_. The ``Registry`` class already inherits from ``ABCMeta``,
so the decorator ``from abc import abstractmethod`` will automatically work with
subclasses of ``Registry``. For convenience, you can import the ``abstractmethod``
decorator from ``autoregistry`` as well.

.. code-block:: python

   from autoregistry import Registry, abstractmethod


   class Pokemon(Registry):
       @abstractmethod
       def attack(self, target) -> int:
           pass


   class Pikachu(Pokemon):
       def attack(self, target):
           return 5

Here we have defined an interface ``Pokemon`` that currently has one subclass, ``Pikachu``.
Lets investigate what kind of features ``autoregistry`` gives us.

The ``Pokemon`` **class** can be treated like a dictionary, mapping strings to
class-constructors. The keys are derived from the subclasses' names.

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> len(Pokemon)
   1
   >>> Pokemon
   <Pokemon: ['pikachu']>
   >>> list(Pokemon)
   ['pikachu']
   >>> pikachu = Pokemon["pikachu"]()
   >>> pikachu
   <__main__.Pikachu object at 0x10689fb20>

Unlike a dictionary, the queries are, by default, case-insensitive:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> pikachu = Pokemon["pIkAcHU"]()  # Case insensitive works, too.
   >>> "pikachu" in Pokemon
   True
   >>> "PIKACHU" in Pokemon
   True

When querying for an unregistered string, a ``KeyError`` is raised.
You can also use the ``get`` method to handle missing-key queries.
If the provided ``default`` argument is a string, a lookup will be performed.

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> Pokemon["ash"]
   KeyError: 'ash'
   >>> pikachu = Pokemon.get("ash", "pikachu")()
   >>> pikachu = Pokemon.get("ash", Pikachu)()  # The default could also be the constructor.
   >>> pikachu = Pokemon.get("ash")()  # If default is not specified, its None.
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable

The ruleset for deriving keys and valid classnames is configurable. See :ref:`Configuration`.

Decorator-Based
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of using classes, you can also use ``Registry`` to explicitly create a dictionary-like
object and use it to decorate functions.

.. code-block:: python

   from autoregistry import Registry

   my_registry = Registry()


   @my_registry
   def foo(x):
       return x


   @my_registry
   def bar(x):
       return 2 * x

The ``my_registry`` **object** can be treated like a dictionary, mapping strings to
registered functions. The keys are derived from the function names.

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> len(my_registry)
   2
   >>> my_registry
   <Registry: ['foo', 'bar']>
   >>> list(my_registry)
   ['foo', 'bar']
   >>> my_registry["foo"](7)
   7

All of the documentation in `Inheritence-Based`_ is equally valid for the explicitly
created object ``my_registry``.
